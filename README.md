Credit Card Fraud Detection System 
Executive Summary: Strategic Imperative
This project delivers our foundational Machine Learning model for real-time credit card fraud detection. The system is a crucial first step in mitigating financial losses, protecting our customers, and maintaining the integrity of our transaction ecosystem.

The core objective of this initial release is to establish a high-speed, reliable baseline model that can quickly and accurately classify transactions as legitimate (Class 0) or fraudulent (Class 1). The model’s lightweight architecture ensures rapid processing, which is essential for integration into our live transaction pipeline.

Technical Architecture and Design Choices
Component	Technology / Technique	Rationale (CTO Perspective)
Development Environment	Python 3.x, Jupyter Notebook	Standardized, accessible environment for rapid prototyping and iteration.
Core Libraries	NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn	Industry-standard toolkit for data manipulation and classic ML model construction.
Model Selection	Logistic Regression	Chosen as the robust, interpretable, and computationally inexpensive baseline for binary classification. Its speed is paramount for low-latency fraud checks.
Data Preprocessing	Undersampling	This addresses the severe class imbalance (the vast majority of transactions are legitimate). By sampling legitimate transactions to match the small count of fraud cases (≈492 of each), we ensure the model learns from the minority class, preventing high bias and ensuring practical utility.
Evaluation Strategy	Stratified Train-Test Split (80/20)	Ensures that both the training and testing datasets maintain the same crucial ratio of legitimate to fraudulent transactions, leading to a more reliable measure of generalization performance.

Test Data Accuracy: [Placeholder for actual accuracy score]

The achieved Accuracy demonstrates the model's high capability to correctly classify transactions within a balanced subset of our data.

Strategic Roadmap: Next Steps for Production Readiness
While the current model is a strong proof-of-concept, our immediate focus must shift to deployment and maximizing business impact.

Prioritize Business-Relevant Metrics:

Action: Immediately calculate and report Precision (minimizing false alarms for legitimate customers) and Recall (maximizing the capture of actual fraud cases). Accuracy alone is insufficient for an imbalanced real-world problem.

Model Deployment & Integration:

Action: Operationalize the trained model by wrapping it in a low-latency API (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI). This is essential for integration with our transaction processing service for real-time scoring.

Explore Advanced Techniques (Future V2.0):

Action: Investigate more advanced imbalance handling (e.g., SMOTE or Cost-Sensitive Learning) and more sophisticated models (e.g., Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks) to push the boundaries of Precision and Recall.

Feature Engineering & Scaling:

Action: Address the lack of feature names (V1-V28 are PCA-transformed) by ensuring that any new features added in the future are properly scaled and documented for maintainability and interpretability.

How to Run the Code
For the technical team responsible for deployment:

Dependencies: Ensure Python 3.x and the following libraries are installed:

Bash

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
Data: The creditcard.csv file must be accessible at the specified path for the initial data loading cell to execute.

Execution: Run all cells in the Jupyter Notebook (Credit_Fraud.ipynb) sequentially to load data, train the model, and evaluate performance. The final cell demonstrates a single-instance prediction for validation.
